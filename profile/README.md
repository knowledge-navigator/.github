## The Project
The goal of the system when implemented, is to provide a personalized and more streamlined, digital workflow for students and teachers, regarding the knowledge navigator, a tool used among Dixons Academies Trust schools in England. Please read the following page for reference to what a “knowledge navigator” is: https://www.dixonsco.com/why/homework

Organizations (usually schools) will be able to setup workspaces storing all the information found within knowledge navigators. Teachers can register accounts to the service (as part of an organization), utilizing knowledge navigator blocks from their parent organization (the school). Students of the teacher can fill in their knowledge navigator questions, cover-ups and translations online, directly saving the results in a database. This will allow teachers to quickly see which students are suffering on certain topics and may need additional guidance or extra homework. Furthermore, the questions provided to the students could be personalized through an algorithm or possibly AI (research) to enhance the learning of the students.

Essentially, this revised, online knowledge navigator will make it easier for teachers to utilize the existing knowledge navigator model with customized questions for the students, instant feedback on the what the students filled in as well as easy sharing of knowledge navigator content across organizations, subjects, and teachers.
