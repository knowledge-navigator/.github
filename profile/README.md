## Context
The goal of the system when implemented, is to provide a personalized and more streamlined, digital workflow for students and teachers, regarding the **Knowledge Navigator**, a tool used among Dixons Academies Trust schools in England. Please read the following page for reference on what a **Knowledge Navigator** exactly is: https://www.dixonsco.com/why/homework

Organizations (usually schools) will be able to setup workspaces storing all the information found within Knowledge Navigators. Teachers can register accounts to the service (as part of an organization), utilizing Knowledge Navigator blocks from their parent organization (the school). Students of the teacher can fill in their knowledge navigator questions, cover-ups and translations online, directly saving the results in a database. This will allow teachers to quickly see which students are suffering on certain topics and may need additional guidance or extra homework. Furthermore, the questions provided to the students could be personalized through an algorithm or possibly AI (research) to enhance the learning of the students.

Essentially, this revised, online knowledge navigator will make it easier for teachers to utilize the existing knowledge navigator model with customized questions for the students, instant feedback on the what the students filled in as well as easy sharing of knowledge navigator content across organizations, subjects, and teachers.

## Current Existing System
The current system is primarily done by hand and on paper. Every day, students are given a section of the knowledge navigator to complete as homework. This means that each day has one different subject from the knowledge navigator, thus five different knowledge navigator assignments and subjects weekly. Students are expected to read specific chunks of information, cover these sections up and then write down accurately, from memory, this chunk of information. Students then check their answer with the knowledge navigator booklet, correcting any errors and filling gaps with specifically a green pen. This process is repeated by the student until he writes all the information 100% correctly through a single cycle.

The flaws of this system are that the homework is not personalized for the student (specific boxes are just given to all students regardless of their knowledge level), nor are the results easy to see for the teacher (the teacher must view each studentâ€™s homework individually to gauge how many mistakes were made).

## Proposed System
This new system will provide personalized content for the student to memorize and write down, with thereafter, a prompt on how they felt they did on the section. The green pen technique is still used, but the information chunks are essentially provided on screen, rather than through a booklet. Additionally, students, through filling in reflection prompts (post doing the knowledge navigator memorization and answering), will provide vital data to the teacher on their own interpretation of how well they think they know set subject. This can be useful information for the teacher to see.
